# stakoku-solver
Python project that solves Stackoku puzzles: (https://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/published/stackoku2/index.html)

The rules are simple:

Put the digits 1-3 (later 1-4) in some of the squares so that each row and column contains exactly one of each digit and two blank squares. If two digits are vertically adjacent, the one on top must be larger.

Solving them is a bit more complicated.  This is a small, rules based Stackoku solver that I built as a test to see how hard it would be for a computer to solve the problem.
